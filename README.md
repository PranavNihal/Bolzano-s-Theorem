Hello Everyone,
The given code provides us a way to use the Bolzano's Theorem to approximate the root of the given function using the conditions of the Theorem
The statement of Bolzano's Theorem is:
For a continuous function f defined on the closed interval [a,b], where f(a) â‰  f(b) and d is real number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one real number c between in the interval (a,b) such that f(c) = d.
